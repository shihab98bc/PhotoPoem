## Deployment to Vercel

To deploy this project to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Link your Git repository:** Connect your GitHub repository containing this project to your Vercel account.
2. **Configure Project:** Vercel should automatically detect that this is a Next.js project. The build command and start command should be automatically configured.
3. **Configure Environment Variables:** If your project requires any environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials), add them in the Project Settings under the "Environment Variables" section. Refer to your project's code (e.g., `.env.local`, `next.config.ts`) for necessary variables.
4. **Deploy:** Trigger a deployment through the Vercel dashboard or by pushing changes to your linked Git branch.

Vercel will build and deploy your application. You can then access it at the provided Vercel URL.
